pgc-heatmap
===========

This is an experimental animated heatmap using the SODA Api, Heatmap.js, and the leaflet-heatmap plugin.  

See it in action at [http://chriswhong.github.io/nyc-heatmap](http://chriswhong.github.io/nyc-heatmap)

I copied it from Chris W Hong's github.

What I want to do is use a different SODA end-point,  but create the same
type of visualization.    That is a map, that creates a heat-map through time

I'm in San Francisco, so'm going to use datasf.org data
I've been looking at reports sent into SF311, particularly graffitt, but also
park information, street lights, street cleaning, crime. etc.

I'm going to give it a different name repository.
